# OAuth 2 Resource Server Example

OAuth 2 Resource Server Example. Integrates with keycloak to authenticate requests.

The project requires an authorization server. The Docker compose file will take care of this, while running the project:

```
docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up
```

The resource server API is located at [http://localhost:8080/rest/entity](http://localhost:8080/rest/entity), accessible to the user test-user/1234.

Import `src/test/resources/Oauth.postman_collection.json` to get queries for all the operations. Including authentication and reading.

## Documentation

Documentation is always generated for the latest release, kept in the 'master' branch:

- The [latest release documentation page][site-release].
- The [latest release Javadoc site][javadoc-release].

Documentation is also generated from the latest snapshot, taken from the 'develop' branch:

- The [the latest snapshot documentation page][site-develop].
- The [latest snapshot Javadoc site][javadoc-develop].

The documentation site is actually a Maven site, and its sources are included in the project. If required it can be generated by using the following Maven command:

```
mvn verify site
```

The verify phase is required, otherwise some of the reports won't be generated.
