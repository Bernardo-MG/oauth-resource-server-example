# OAuth 2 Resource Server Example

OAuth 2 Resource Server Example. Requires the [OAuth 2 Authorization Server Example](https://github.com/Bernardo-MG/oauth-authorization-server-example) to be running, as it will handle request authorization.

Just get both projects runnings and make a request query to http://localhost:8080/rest/entity.
